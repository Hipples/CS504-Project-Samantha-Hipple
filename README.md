CS 504: Software Engineering Independent &amp; Team Project Repository

### Independent Project Overview
An independent project requires each student to analyze an instructor-approved topic and its requirement, design a system or component based on the given subject, implement the designed system, and test the system. The paper must be no less than 3-4 pages, excluding the title and reference pages, using APA format, with at least five (5) recent, scholarly/non-scholarly, peer- or non-peer-reviewed references. As in any academic writing, students should not merely copy information from another author, but use evidence to support the contentions they have drawn from their findings and critically analyze related literature. Each paper needs to be an analytical paper, not a summary of readings.

Students must cite the sources of all ideas, facts, tables, images, figures, formulas, and information used that are not their own, even if they have put the information into their own words. Failure to do so is plagiarism, even if the oversight is unintentional. Papers must comply with the Universityâ€™s academic integrity policy, as described in the university catalog.
