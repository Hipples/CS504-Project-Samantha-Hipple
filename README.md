IP01 Instructions: 
Configuration Management is a very widely used process in managing complex systems, and software lifecycle is no exception. This process is integral for establishing and maintaining the consistency of the product throughout its life cycle. Software Configuration Management systems track and monitor changes to a software system's configuration metadata. This goes hand in hand with Version Control and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery which includes the build function as well. 

One of the most challenging parts of designing a solution is choosing the platform and dependencies. There are certain services to assist with comparing different tools and making decisions. G2 is a peer-reviewing service for evaluating business software. Software Advice is another tool from a research and analyst company for reviewing software. StackOverflow Insights and StackShare can also be used to gain better clarity on the technologies and services being used. 

Students can use any form of documentation or any of the popular options for CMS systems. Some options may include: 

Enterprise Level:
    x. IBM Rational ClearCase 
    x. Azure DevOps Server
    x. Puppet Enterprise 
    x. Chef Enterprise Automation Stack 
    x. Perforce 

Open Source:
    x. Open Source Puppet 
    x. Open Source Chef 
    x. Chef Infra   
    x. Chef Habitat 
    x. Chef Automate 
    x. Azure DevOps Server Express 
    x. Red Hat Ansible 

Each student will implement and demonstrate test cases in a Configuration Management System (CMS) of their choice. Specific instructions may be provided upon request in addition to the documentation of the CMS selected. Once the CMS has been implemented, the student will create at least two accounts in the system, including one with applicable administrative rights. The student will create test cases to demonstrate how the following situations are handled in the CMS. Below is a suggestion for the processes: 

    x. Code checkout (or Git Clone) 
    x. Code checkin (or Git Commit) 
    x. Code Pull request 
    x. Code Merge 
    x. Code snapshot (or release point) 
    x. Code in development by two users, 
        x. first one checks out code, 
        x. second checks out code, makes changes and checks in, 
        x. first makes changes and needs to check in. 
    x. Code changes need to be rolled back to a previous version (revert). 
    x. One developer is working on a new version, one is fixing bugs in a previous release (Git fork). 
    x. Define runtime variable for your software 
    x. Deploy the software on your local machine or a cloud  
    x. Write a CMS playbook (configuration file) to change the runtime variable in the configuration file.  

Each process must be documented.
