# Submisson 5

Each student will produce samples or shells of the documentation for the development project from previous assignments.  Each document should include a short explanation of how and why it is used.  (Note: Documentation does not need to be paper, or word processor based). 

The documentation must be consistent with the process model previously selected.  Samples or shells must be complete enough to demonstrate that the student knows how to use the documents properly. 

The documentation must include an "After Action Review" or "Lessons Learned" document.   This document will apply specifically to lessons learned during the assignments in the course. 

Make sure to include the inputs and outputs to the system.  


Students can use any form of documentation or any of the popular documentation tools. Some options may include:
