## IP4: Software Metrics

### Instructions

Software metrics are an important component for quality assurance, management, performance and overall estimation of costs of a software. The overall quality of a software may depend on the software metrics of that software or the other dependencies and Application Programming Interface (APIs) used in the design of the software.  


Some common metrics for assessing APIâ€™s include: 
+ Availability
+ Error code
+ Response time
+ Latency 

Common metrics for assessing software include: 
+ Maintainability Index
+ Cyclomatic Complexity
+ Depth of Inheritance
+ Class Coupling
+ Lines of Source code
+ Lines of Executable code 
 

There are certain tools to assist with measuring such metrics. Code Metrics and Code Clone Analysis are available through Visual Studio for software metrics. SonarQube is an automated code review tool for code quality and code security checks. SonarQube can be installed on a docker container very easily or on a server for wider accessibility. 

Each student will develop metrics for the validation and acceptance testing of the system designed in previous assignments. The student will describe how he or she collect and evaluate each metric. The student will describe why each of the metrics has been selected and what the effect of the metric is on the overall project quality. Students can use any of the suggested tools or any other tools based on their specific use case.
