### IP02: Requirements and Architecture

Requirement Engineering involves some important steps to ensure the quality of a designed software product. These steps include: 
- Elicitation
- Documentation and definition
- Specification
- Prototyping
- Analysis
- Review and validation
- Agreement and acceptance 

Currently available tools in the market support some or all of the steps mentioned above.  

Each student will conduct a requirements engineering process based on a specific business, mission, or operational need of their choice preferably related to their professional career. The student will map the resulting requirements into a systems architecture or high-level design and trace the mapping of requirements to modules in the architecture. 

The instructor will provide guidance to the student (upon request) on the development effort and resources to be used in the requirements gathering.

The student will choose an architectural style based on the appropriateness of the style to the requirements. Based on the style the student will complete the architecture/high level design to the level where it is ready for implementation.

The student will create all design artifacts appropriate to the selected style.

For example, a project idea would be to design the requirements management for a crawler system with high performance (avoid having to download the same page twice), speed and reliability.


Students can use any form of documentation (such as Microsoft word, ...) or any of the popular options for RMS systems. Some options may include:
